## Structure
* **mpro_6lze**
  * **docksetup** files needed to run docking  
  * **raw** sample of the docking outputs that contain *smiles, dockscore, coordinates*          
  * **trained_weights** trained MPNN weights  
* **selected structures** a small subset of selected structures of interest to test in experiment
